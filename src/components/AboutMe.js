      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p><em><b>Hi, my name is Ayo. I am a software developer based in London.</b></em></p>
      <p>
        I have been working in retail for 10+ years now, in addition to graduating with a Bachelor of Science degree in Business.
        This has given me both theoretical and practical experience in the business world, as well as a good understanding of customers' needs and wants.
        The latter particularly enabled me to connect with developers and explore a career in coding.
      </p>
      <p>
        My interest in web development started while in secondary school and working on my own project.
        After speaking with developers that I know and doing a little coding independently, I decided to enrol full-time at General Assembly on a software engineering course.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am excited about starting my career as a developer, building on the skills I have learnt and providing a valuable contribution to an organisation while continuing to develop within a great team.
        I enjoy working with others and being able to exchange creative ideas while working together on compelling projects.
